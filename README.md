  </summary>

## RISCV
RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture used to develop custom processors for Variety of applications.

## TL Verilog
Transaction level verilog or TL Verilog is an emerging System Verilog that supports a new design methodology, called transaction level design.




### Combinational circuits 
Circuits dont have any memory , the output of the circuit at any instant of time , depends only on the levels present at input terminals .

### LAB EXERSCISES :

A simple combinational calculator :

### Sequential logic:
A sequential logic introduces a clock .It has memory 

### LAB EXERSCISES :
A simple example of counter :
